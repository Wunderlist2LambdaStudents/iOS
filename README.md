# Wunderlist 

Welcome to our app Wunderlist! Within our app you will be able to keep track of your typical to-do list tasks. You are able to track whether you need to do your tasks daily, weekly or monthly, and get alerts and notifications to help remind you of when you need to do one of your tasks. We also implemented a feature where you are able to check off which tasks you have already completed. With Wunderlist you will be able to keep all of your to-dos in one location to never forget about the tasks your day to day life may require.
